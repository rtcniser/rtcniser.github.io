The RoboTech Club harbours 3D printers (FDM, SLA) and Laser Cutter in the lab for prototyping and fabrication purposes. Our electronics workspace is fully equipped with an oscilloscope, power supply units, soldering and rework stations, and charging stations. We also have a range of tools for solid rework, including an angle grinder, hacksaws, a drilling kit, and customizable wrenches and screwdrivers. Supported by powerful computers and advanced computing setups, we are well-prepared to efficiently carry out a wide variety of projects.
