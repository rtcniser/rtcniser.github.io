<p class="headings">Overview of this edition</p>
<p> The Theme for Yantriki ed2 is “Forging Novel Horizons”. This year, Yantriki serves as an
 exposé on the hidden bizarre connections robotics has with any other field one can
 think of. The fields of soft robotics and biomimicry serve as examples. This edition will
 explore how various fields other than traditional robotics are incorporated into designing
 and enhancing robots or how the field of robotics is helping in the advancement of
 different fields, with emphasis on the former.</p>
