## Updation Guidelines

- **Use .webp instead of .jpg** : For website images, webp images of similar quality takes lesser space. Hence, lesser loading times for pages.
- **Segragate/chunk year-wise information** : Don't let everything load at once. Make separate tabs or dropdowns.
- **CLean** : Don't add too much unnecessary details. Have proper formatting with minimal colours to make the pages beautiful and easy to read.
