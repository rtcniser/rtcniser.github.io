# RoboTech Club's Website

## Updation Guidelines

- **Use .webp instead of .jpg** : For website images, webp images of similar quality takes lesser space. Hence, lesser loading times for pages.
- **Segragate/chunk year-wise information** : Do not let everything load at once. Make separate tabs or dropdowns.
- **Cleanliness** : Do not add too much unnecessary details. Have proper formatting with minimal colours to make the pages beautiful and easy to read.
- **Privacy and Safety** : Let us not include personal/NISER email IDs or phone numbers in the website, keeping in mind the possibility of spam or misuse. For any communication purposes it could be directed through RTC's email ID and other social media platforms.
